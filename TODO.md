# TODO: Fix UI of Appointment Request Form Modal in today.tsx

## Tasks

- [x] Add scrollContent style for consistent padding inside ScrollView
- [x] Adjust modalContent style to remove conflicting properties (flex: 1)
- [x] Test modal layout and scrolling on different screen sizes
- [x] Ensure consistent spacing and alignment throughout the modal

## Dependent Files
